      <h1 id="sec:model-specification-proc">Model Specification using
      Processes</h1>
      <p>In this section, we provide an informal description of the
      process calculus now integrated in tamarin. It is called SAPIC,
      which stands for “Stateful Applied PI-Calculus”. The full details
      of this model can be found in <span class="citation"
      data-cites="KK-jcs16">(Kremer and Künnemann 2016)</span> and <span
      class="citation" data-cites="BaDrKr-2016-liveness">(Backes et al.
      2017)</span>.</p>
      <p>A Protocol can be modelled in terms of rules or as a (single)
      process. The process is translated into a set of rules that adhere
      to the semantics of the process calculus. It is even possible to
      mix a process declaration and a set of rules, although this is not
      recommended, as the interactions between the rules and the process
      depend on how precisely this translation is defined.</p>
      <h2 id="sec:proc">Processes</h2>
      <p><img src="../images/sapic-overview.png"
      alt="Syntax of SAPIC, where a is a fresh name, x a variable, m and n terms, F a fact and P a predicate." /><br />
      </p>
      <p>The SAPIC calculus is a dialect of the applied-pi calculus with
      additional features for storing, retrieving and modifying global
      state.</p>
      <h3 id="standard-applied-pi-features">Standard applied-pi
      features</h3>
      <p>The main ingredients for modelling protocols are network
      communication and parallelism. We start with the network
      communication and other constructs that model local operation.</p>
      <p>The processes <code>out(m,n); P</code> and
      <code>in(m,n); P</code> represent the output, respectively input,
      of message <code>n</code> on channel <code>m</code>. As opposed to
      the applied pi calculus <span class="citation"
      data-cites="AF-popl01">(Abadi and Fournet 2001)</span>, SAPiC’s
      input construct performs pattern matching instead of variable
      binding.</p>
      <!--
      TODO example here
      -->
      <p>If the channel is left out, the public channel <code>'c'</code>
      is assumed, which is the case in the majority of our examples.
      This is exactly what the facts <code>In(m)</code> and
      <code>Out(m)</code> represent. Processes can also branch:
      <code>if Pred then P else Q</code> will execute either
      <code>P</code> or <code>Q</code>, depending on whether
      <code>Pred</code> holds. As of now, only the equality check is
      implemented, hence Pred always has the form <code>t = t'</code>
      for terms <code>t</code> and <code>t'</code>.</p>
      <p>The construct <code>new a;P</code> binds the fresh name
      <code>a</code> in <code>P</code>. Similar to the fact
      <code>Fr(a)</code>, it models the generation of a fresh, random
      value.</p>
      <p>The <code>event</code> construct is similar to actions in
      rules. In fact, it will be translated to actions. Like in rules,
      events annotate parts of the processes and are useful for stating
      security properties. Each of these constructs can be thought of as
      “local” computations. They are separated with a semicolon
      <code>;</code> and are terminated with <code>0</code>, the
      terminal process or null process. This is a process that does
      nothing. It is allowed to omit trailing <code>0</code> processes
      and <code>else</code>-branches that consist of a <code>0</code>
      process.</p>
      <p>We can now come to the operations modelling parallelism.
      <code>P | Q</code> is the parallel execution of processes P and Q.
      This is used, e.g., to model two participants in a protocol.</p>
      <p><code>!P</code> is the replication of P, which allows an
      unbounded number of sessions in protocol executions. It can be
      thought of to be an infinite number of processes
      <code>P | .. | P</code> running in parallel. If <code>P</code>
      describes a webserver answering a single query, then
      <code>!P</code> is the webserver answering queries indefinitely.
      <code>P+Q</code> denotes external non-deterministic choice, which
      can be used to model alternatives. In that sense, it is closer to
      a condition rather than two processes running in parallel:
      <code>P+Q</code> reduces to <em>either</em> <code>P'</code> or
      <code>Q'</code>, the follow-up processes or <code>P</code> or
      <code>Q</code> respectively.</p>
      <h3 id="manipulation-of-global-state">Manipulation of global
      state</h3>
      <p>The remaining constructs are used to manipulate global
      state.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The construct <code>insert m,n; P</code> binds the value
      <code>n</code> to the key <code>m</code>. Successive inserts
      overwrite this binding. The store is global, but as <code>m</code>
      is a term, it can be used to define name spaces. E.g., if a
      webserver is identified by a name <code>w_id</code>, then it could
      prefix it’s store as follows:
      <code>insert &lt;'webservers',w_id,'store'&gt;, data; P</code>.</li>
      <li>The construct <code>delete m; P</code> ‘undefines’ the
      binding.</li>
      <li>The construct <code>lookup m as x in P else Q</code> allows
      for retrieving the value associated to <code>m</code> and binds it
      to the variable <code>x</code> if entering <code>P</code>. If the
      mapping is undefined for <code>m</code>, the process behaves as
      <code>Q</code>.</li>
      <li>The <code>lock</code> and <code>unlock</code> constructs are
      used to gain or waive exclusive access to a resource
      <code>m</code>, in the style of Dijkstra’s binary semaphores: if a
      term <code>m</code> has been locked, any subsequent attempt to
      lock <code>m</code> will be blocked until <code>m</code> has been
      unlocked. This is essential for writing protocols where parallel
      processes may read and update a common memory.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is a hidden feature for experts: inline multiset-rewrite
      rules: <code>[l] --[a]-&gt; r; P</code> is a valid process.
      Embedded rules apply if their preconditions apply (i.e., the facts
      on the left-hand-side are present) <strong>and</strong> the
      process is reduced up to this rule. If the rule applies in the
      current state, the process reduces to <code>P</code>. We advice to
      avoid these rules whenever possible, as they run counter to the
      aim of SAPIC: to provide clear, provably correct high-level
      abstractions for the modelling of protocols. Note also that the
      state-manipulation constructs <code>lookup x as v</code>,
      <code>insert x,y</code> and <code>delete x</code> manage state by
      emitting actions <code>IsIn(x,y')</code>, <code>Insert(x,y)</code>
      and <code>Delete(x)</code> and enforcing their proper semantics
      via restrictions. For example: an action <code>IsIn(x,y)</code>,
      which expresses a succesful lookup, requires that an action
      <code>Insert(x,y)</code> has occurred previously, and in between,
      no other <code>Insert(x,y')</code> or <code>Delete(x)</code>
      action has changed the global store at the position
      <code>x</code>. Hence, the global store is distinct from the set
      of facts in the current state.</p>
      <h3 id="enforcing-local-progress-optional">Enforcing local
      progress (optional)</h3>
      <p>The translation from processes can be modified so it enforces a
      different semantics. In this semantics, the set of traces consists
      of only those where a process has been reduced <strong>as far as
      possible</strong>. A process can reduce unless it is waiting for
      some input, it is under replication, or unless it is already
      reduced up to the 0-process.</p>
      <pre><code>options: translation-progress</code></pre>
      <p>This can be used to model time-outs. The following process must
      reduce to either <code>P</code> or <code>out('help');0</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>( in(x); P) + (out(&#39;help&#39;);0)</code></pre>
      <p>If the input message received, it will produce regulary, in
      this example: with <code>P</code>. If the input is not received,
      there is no other way to progress except for the right-hand side.
      But progress it must, so the right-hand side can model a recovery
      protocol.</p>
      <p>In the translated rules, events <code>ProgressFrom_p</code> and
      <code>ProgressTo_p</code> are added. Here <code>p</code> marks a
      position that, one reached, requires the corresponding
      <code>ProgressTo</code> event to appear. This is enforced by
      restrictions. Note that a process may need to process to more than
      one position, e.g.,</p>
      <pre><code>new a; (new b; 0 | new c; 0)</code></pre>
      <p>progresses to both trailing 0-processes.</p>
      <p>It may also process to one out of many positions, e.g.,
      here</p>
      <pre><code>in(x); if x=&#39;a&#39; then 0 else 0</code></pre>
      <p>More details can be found in the corrsponding paper <span
      class="citation" data-cites="BaDrKr-2016-liveness">(Backes et al.
      2017)</span>. Note that local progress by itself does not
      guarantee that messages arrive. Recovery protocols often rely on a
      trusted third party, which is possibly offline most of time, but
      can be reached using <a
      href="004_cryptographic-messages.html#sec:builtin-theories">the
      builtin theory for reliable channels</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="modeling-isolated-execution-environments">Modeling
      Isolated Execution Environments</h3>
      <p>IEEs, or enclaves, allow to run code inside a secure
      environment and to provide a certificate of the current state
      (including the executed program) of the enclave. A localized
      version of the applied pi-calculus, defined in <span
      class="citation"
      data-cites="JKS-eurosp17">(<strong>JKS-eurosp17?</strong>)</span>
      and included in SAPIC, allows to model such environments.</p>
      <p>Processes can be given a unique identifier, which we call
      location:</p>
      <pre><code>let A = (...)@loc</code></pre>
      <p>Locations can be any term (which may depend on previous
      inputs). A location is an identifier which allows to talk about
      its process. Inside a location, a report over some value can be
      produced:</p>
      <pre><code>(...
let x=report(m) in
   ...)@loc</code></pre>
      <p>Some external user can then verify that some value has been
      produced at a specific location, i.e produced by a specific
      process or program, by using the <code>check_rep</code>
      function:</p>
      <pre><code>if input=check_rep(rep,loc) then</code></pre>
      <p>This will be valid only if <code>rep</code> has been produced
      by the previous instruction, with <code>m=input</code>.</p>
      <p>An important point about enclaves is that any user, e.g an
      attacker, can use enclaves, and thus produce reports for its own
      processes or locations. But if the attacker can produce a report
      for any location, he can break all security properties associated
      to it. To this end, the user can define a set of untrusted
      locations, which amounts to defining a set of processes that he
      does not trust, by defining a builtin <code>Report</code>
      predicate:</p>
      <pre><code>predicates:
Report(x,y) &lt;=&gt; phi(x,y)</code></pre>
      <p>The attacker can then produce any <code>report(m)@loc</code> if
      <code>phi(m,loc)</code> is true.</p>
      <p>More details can be found in the corresponding paper <span
      class="citation"
      data-cites="JKS-eurosp17">(<strong>JKS-eurosp17?</strong>)</span>,
      and the examples.</p>
      <h2 id="syntactic-sugar">Syntactic sugar</h2>
      <h3 id="process-declarations-using-let">Process declarations using
      <code>let</code></h3>
      <p>It is advisable to structure processes around the protocol
      roles they represent. These can be declared using the let
      construct:</p>
      <pre><code>let Webserver = in(&lt;&#39;Get&#39;,identity..&gt;); ..

let Webbrowser = ..

(! new identity !Webserver) | ! Webbroser</code></pre>
      <p>These can be nested, i.e., this is valid:</p>
      <pre><code>let A = ..
let B = A | A
!B</code></pre>
      <p>Other process calculi, e.g., ProVerif’s dialect of the
      applied-pi calculus, only allow variables in inputs. While it is
      sometimes clearer to write a pattern in a letblock, it may confuse
      users that expect the <code>in</code> construct to bind a
      variable:</p>
      <pre><code>let pat_m1 = &lt;x,y&gt; in
in(pat_m1)</code></pre>
      <p>To avoid unexpected behaviour, we allow a let-expression to
      apply to a single-variable term in an <code>in</code> only if the
      variable is prefixed with <code>pat_</code>, as in the above
      example.</p>
      <h3 id="using-let-binding-in-processes">Using ‘let’ binding in
      processes</h3>
      <p>Similar to rules, <code>let</code>-bindings are allowed to
      faciliate writing processes where a term occur several times
      (possibly as a subterm) within the process rule. The bindings can
      even be nested:</p>
      <pre><code>let foo1 = h(bar)
    foo2 = &lt;&#39;bars&#39;, foo1&gt;
    ...
    var5 = pk(~x)
        in
        in(&lt;&#39;test&#39;,y&gt;); let response = &lt;foo2,y&gt; in out(response)</code></pre>
      <p>Let-bindings in processes adhere to the same rules as <a
      href="#sec:let-rules">let-bindings in rules</a>.</p>
