      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
      <p>The Tamarin prover is a powerful tool for the symbolic modeling
      and analysis of security protocols. It takes as input a security
      protocol model, specifying the actions taken by agents running the
      protocol in different roles (e.g., the protocol initiator, the
      responder, and the trusted key server), a specification of the
      adversary, and a specification of the protocol’s desired
      properties. Tamarin can then be used to automatically construct a
      proof that, even when arbitrarily many instances of the protocol’s
      roles are interleaved in parallel, together with the actions of
      the adversary, the protocol fulfils its specified properties. In
      this manual, we provide an overview of this tool and its use.</p>
      <p>Tamarin provides general support for modeling and reasoning
      about security protocols. Protocols and adversaries are specified
      using an expressive language based on multiset rewriting rules.
      These rules define a labeled transition system whose state
      consists of a symbolic representation of the adversary’s
      knowledge, the messages on the network, information about freshly
      generated values, and the protocol’s state. The adversary and the
      protocol interact by updating network messages and generating new
      messages. Tamarin also supports the equational specification of
      some cryptographic operators, such as Diffie-Hellman
      exponentiation and bilinear pairings. Security properties are
      modeled as trace properties, checked against the traces of the
      transition system, or in terms of the observational equivalence of
      two transition systems.</p>
      <p>Tamarin provides two ways of constructing proofs. It has an
      efficient, fully <em>automated mode</em> that combines deduction
      and equational reasoning with heuristics to guide proof search. If
      the tool’s automated proof search terminates, it returns either a
      proof of correctness (for an unbounded number of role instances
      and fresh values) or a counterexample, representing an attack that
      violates the stated property. However, since the correctness of
      security protocols is an undecidable problem, the tool may not
      terminate on a given verification problem. Hence, users may need
      to resort to Tamarin’s <em>interactive mode</em> to explore the
      proof states, inspect attack graphs, and seamlessly combine manual
      proof guidance with automated proof search.</p>
      <p>A formal treatment of Tamarin’s foundations is given in the
      theses of <span class="citation"
      data-cites="benediktthesis">(Schmidt 2012)</span> and <span
      class="citation" data-cites="meierthesis">(Meier 2012)</span>. We
      give just a brief (technical) summary here. For an equational
      theory <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> defining
      cryptographic operators, a multiset rewriting system <span
      class="math inline">\(R\)</span> defining a protocol, and a
      formula <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> defining a trace
      property, Tamarin can either check the validity or the
      satisfiability of <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> for
      the traces of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> modulo <span
      class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. As usual, validity checking is
      reduced to checking the satisfiability of the negated formula.
      Here, constraint solving is used to perform an exhaustive,
      symbolic search for executions with satisfying traces. The states
      of the search are constraint systems. For example, a constraint
      can express that some multiset rewriting step occurs in an
      execution or that one step occurs before another step. We can also
      directly use formulas as constraints to express that some behavior
      does not occur in an execution. Applications of constraint
      reduction rules, such as simplifications or case distinctions,
      correspond to the incremental construction of a satisfying trace.
      If no further rules can be applied and no satisfying trace was
      found, then no satisfying trace exists. For symbolic reasoning, we
      exploit the finite variant property <span class="citation"
      data-cites="Comon-LundhD05">(Comon-Lundh and Delaune 2005)</span>
      to reduce reasoning modulo <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>
      with respect to <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> to
      reasoning modulo <span class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> with
      respect to the variants of <span
      class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>
      <p>This manual is written for researchers and practitioners who
      wish to use Tamarin to model and analyze security protocols. We
      assume the reader is familiar with basic cryptography and the
      basic workings of security protocols. Our focus is on explaining
      Tamarin’s usage so that a new user can download, install, and use
      the system. We do not attempt to describe Tamarin’s formal
      foundations and refer the reader to the related theses and
      scientific papers for these details.</p>
      <h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
      <p>In practice, the Tamarin tool has proven to be highly
      successful. It features support for trace and observational
      equivalence properties, automatic and interactive modes, and has
      built-in support for equational theories such as the one modeling
      Diffie-Hellman Key exchanges. It supports a (limited) form of
      induction, and efficiently parallelizes its proof search. It has
      been applied to numerous protocols from different domains
      including:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Advanced key agreement protocols based on Diffie-Hellman
      exponentiation, such as verifying Naxos with respect to the eCK
      (extended Canetti Krawczyk) model; see <span class="citation"
      data-cites="SchmidtMCB12">(Schmidt et al. 2012)</span>.</li>
      <li>The Attack Resilient Public Key Infrastructure (ARPKI) <span
      class="citation" data-cites="ARPKI">(Basin et al.
      2014)</span>.</li>
      <li>Transport Layer Security (TLS) <span class="citation"
      data-cites="TLS">(Cremers et al. 2016)</span></li>
      <li>and many others</li>

      <p>In the next Section <a
      href="002_installation.html#sec:installation">Installation</a> we
      describe how to install Tamarin. First-time users are then
      recommended to read Section <a
      href="003_example.html#initial-example">First Example</a> which
      describes a simple protocol analysis in detail, but without
      technicalities. Then, we systematically build up the technical
      background a user needs, by first presenting the cryptographic
      messages in Section <a
      href="004_cryptographic-messages.html#equational-theories">Cryptographic
      Messages</a>, followed by two different possible modeling
      approaches in Sections 5 and 6, covering <a
      href="005_protocol-specification-rules.html#sec:model-specification">Protocol
      Specification using Rules</a> and <a
      href="006_protocol-specification-processes.html#sec:model-specification-proc">Protocol
      Specification using Processes</a>. Property specification is then
      covered in Section <a
      href="007_property-specification.html#sec:property_specification">Property
      Specification</a>.</p>
      <p>We then continue with information on precomputation in Section
